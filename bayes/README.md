# bayes

This is a talk I gave at Uber about Bayes' Theorem + Bayesian Inference (including my world famous package [bayesAB](https://github.com/FrankPortman/bayesAB)).

## How to build

In your terminal, assuming R and `rmarkdown` are installed:
```
Rscript -e 'rmarkdown::render("bayes.Rmd")'

```

## What's included here

- Raw rmarkdown file that generates slides + figures
- Final output `bayes.html`
- Some intermediate files for `bayes.html` to be viewable on Github
